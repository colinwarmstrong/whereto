# WhereTo?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/colinwarmstrong/whereto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/colinwarmstrong/whereto)

[WhereTo?](https://colinwarmstrong.github.io/whereto-frontend/index.html) is an application built to help users planning on moving across the country.  It utilizes data from [OpenDataSoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/1000-largest-us-cities-by-population-with-geographic-coordinates/table/?sort=-rank) to show information about the 1000 most populated cities in America.  Users can then sort, search, favorite, and reject cities based on their preferences. The backend is a Rails API and the frontend is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  To see what new features are currently in the works, you can take a look at the the project on [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2222980).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a terminal application and a text editor.

### Installing

From your terminal, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/whereto.git
```

Change into the directory:

```
cd whereto
```

Install and update gems:

```
bundle install
bundle update
```

Setup the database:

```
rake db:create,migrate,seed}
```

The repository is now setup on your local machine. To run a local version of the repository, first spin up a local Rails server:

```
rails s
```

Once the server is up and running, visit [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cities](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cities) or any of the other endpoints to see the JSON that is returned.


## Running the tests

The test suite is built using RSpec.  After setting up the respository locally, run the following command to run the test suite:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Endpoints

All endpoints can be accessed by appending them to the root URL `https://where-to-1.herokuapp.com`
